# 4x4 Tic Tac Toe Game
This is a simple 4x4 Tic Tac Toe game that can be played by two players or against an AI opponent. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and can be played in any modern web browser.

How to Play
To start the game, open the index.html file in your web browser. You will be presented with a 4x4 grid of cells. The first player to start the game is X, and the second player is O. Players take turns clicking on the cells to place their marks. The first player to get four in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all cells are filled and there is no winner, the game ends in a draw.
