# 4x4 Tic Tac Toe Game
This is a simple 4x4 Tic Tac Toe game that can be played by two players or against an AI opponent. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and can be played in any modern web browser.

## How to Play(with an AI opponent):
1. Open the index.html file in your web browser. 
2. The game will start automatically, and Player 1 will be X.
3. Click on an empty cell in the grid to make a move.
4. If a player gets four X's or O's in a row, column, or diagonal, they win the game.
5. If the grid is full and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
6. To start a new game, click the "Restart" button.

## How it works: 
The game is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game board is represented by an HTML table, and each cell in the table is represented by a JavaScript object. The game logic is implemented in JavaScript, and it keeps track of the state of the game board and the current player. When a player makes a move, the game logic updates the state of the game board and checks if the move resulted in a win or a draw. If the game is not over, the game logic switches the current player to the other player. The game board is displayed using CSS, and the current state of the game is displayed to the user using an HTML element.

## Future enhancements:
This implementation of the 4x4 tic-tac-toe game is fairly basic and can be enhanced in a number of ways. Some ideas for future enhancements include:
1. The AI opponent makes random moves in this version, however a simple algorithm can be used to make decisions about where to play, or it could use more advanced techniques like machine learning.
2. Adding sound effects to the game to make it more engaging.
3. Adding animations to the game to make it more visually appealing.
